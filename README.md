# Genetic Subtype Prediction of Brain Tumors

## Project Overview

This project investigated the feasibility of using machine learning to predict the genetic subtype of brain tumors based on MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) protein expression levels. 
MGMT plays a critical role in DNA repair, influencing tumor response to alkylating agents, a common class of chemotherapeutic drugs. 
Understanding MGMT expression patterns is valuable for personalized cancer treatment and improved tumor diagnosis.

## Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model for classifying MGMT protein expression in brain tumor samples.
- Evaluate the model's performance in predicting the genetic subtype of brain tumors.

## Data
The project utilized a private dataset of brain tumor samples containing information on MGMT protein expression and genetic subtype labels.

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning: Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Normalization: Standardized features to ensure consistent scales for machine learning algorithms.
- Various deep learning architectures were evaluated.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimized model parameters (learning rate, optimizer, etc.) to achieve the best possible performance.

## Model Evaluation
- Metrics: Employed metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and potentially area under the ROC curve (AUC) to assess model performance comprehensively.
- Cross-validation: Utilized a robust cross-validation approach (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to mitigate overfitting and ensure generalizability.

## Results
The project achieved moderately promising results. **(Ranking 3/8)**
